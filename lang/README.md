### How to contribute to the translations

First, you need an account here on https://anvil.reforged.gg. Go make one if you have not already!

Got an account? Next up, you need to fork this repository by clicking the Fork button up in the top right corner. This will take you to a new page after it's finished, and the URL will be something like `https://anvil.reforged.gg/fatyg5/Reforged-Mod-Language`. Save that webpage, because you will probably want to go there a lot.

Now you're all set to start translating! Here's how you do it. First you need to find the language you are adding to, for this example we will look at French, but obviously this will be different depending on the language you are translating the mod for. Find the .lang file for the language on your fork's main page.

Once you're there, you will see a very long text file. To download it, click the cloud on the top right.

After you have downloaded your lang file, do the same with the latest US English language file.

From here, you can download this program to find differences in language files: https://github.com/FabioZumbi12/Properties-Translator/releases/tag/1.1.

![Downloading the Differences Program](https://gyazo.com/2e718765c1fb9254c3e9d8ec62d4ae39.png "Differences Program")

Open the .zip file as you normally would and run the PropertiesLoader.exe.

From here use the program to load the en_US language file as well as whatever language file you are planning to translate.

To edit a line, double click in the box under the "Translation Tab". To edit newly added keys click on any of the options on the right side of the program labeled "New Lines". After you have finished translating, save your file.

##Submitting your changes

To submit your language file changes, open your fork of the language repository and open your language file again. Find the button in the top right of the page that says "Replace" and upload and replace the file. Add a commit message if you please.

To merge your fork into the main repository, go to the "Merge Request" section on the left side of your personal fork. Click the "Merge Request" button in the top right of the page.

When merging your fork, ensure that the "Source Branch" is set to your personal repository, something along the lines of "USERNAME/Reforged-Mod-Language" and your "master" section and that the "Target Branch" is "language/Reforged-Mod-Language" and the master section as well.

![Merging branches](https://gyazo.com/1539e6eea59b62cfb642c6713c6cd2c0.png "Merge Request 101")

After you click "Compare Branches", give the merge a brief title that explains what you changed or added and add a description if necessary. Ignore everything else. After that, submit your merge request. 

#### Updating your language files

When someone has modified their language files, your repository will not be automatically updated. To update your repository, first go to the Main Repository labeled "Reforged-Mod-Language". Follow the same steps as when you were submitting a merge request to the Main repository, but in reverse.

![Updating files](https://gyazo.com/d9e208c0fcd19b560a2a4022c5dc812e.png "Updating Files")

Now, return to your fork and navigate to the "Merge Requests" section and accept the latest merge request.

Happy translating!
